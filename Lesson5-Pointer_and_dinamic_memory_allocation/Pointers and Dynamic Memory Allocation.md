# 1. Introduction to Pointers
## 1.1 What are pointers ? 
What are Pointers? Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable.
They are a powerful feature in languages like C and C++, allowing for direct memory access and manipulation. 

## 1.2 Why it usefull?
Well the first reason is that pointer make the code memory efficient for example Instead of passing large structures or arrays, you can pass their addresses.
Another reason that makes pointers so special is that They are crucial for using dynamic memory allocation (e.g., malloc, free in C).
And lastely , Pointers are fundamental in creating complex data structures like linked lists, trees, etc.

## 1.3 Basic Syntax
So how we declare a pointer? 
### 1.3.1 Declaring a pointer
Here is how we declare a pointer: 
```c
int* ptr; // pointer to an integer .
```
### 1.3.2 Assigning an Address
Use the `&` operator to get the address of a variable.
```c
int num = 10 ; 
ptr  = &num ;  // ptr hold the address of num 
printf("%p" , ptr); // prints the memory address. "%p" is used to print memory addresses. 
```

### 1.3.3 Dereferencing a Pointer 
Use the `*` operator to access the value at the address the pointer is pointing to.

```c
printf("%d" , *ptr); // prints the value stored in memory address. 
```

**Example**
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int num = 10; 
    int*  ptr = &num; 

    printf("The address of num using & is : %p \n" , &num);
    printf("The value of ptr is : %p \n" , ptr); 
    printf("Dereferencing ptr give us that value of num: %d \n " ,*ptr)
}
```

### 1.3.4 Null Pointer 
A pointer that is not assigned any address. It's good practice to initialize pointers to NULL to avoid undefined behavior.
```c
int* ptr = NULL ; 
```

### 1.3.5 Pointer to Arrays
Array Name as a Pointer:

- The name of an array acts as a pointer to its first element. For example, if you have an array `arr`, the expression arr is equivalent to `&arr[0]`.
- This means when you assign `int* ptr = arr;`, you are actually assigning the address of the first element of the array to the pointer ptr.

- When you write int `*ptr = arr;`, youâ€™re effectively saying "point to the first element of `arr`.
```c 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};

    // Using the array name as a pointer to the first element
    int *ptr1 = arr;         // Correct: ptr1 points to arr[0]
    printf("First element via ptr1: %d\n", *ptr1); // Outputs: 10

    // Using & with the first element
    int *ptr2 = &arr[0];     // Also correct: ptr2 points to arr[0]
    printf("First element via ptr2: %d\n", *ptr2); // Outputs: 10

    // Using & with the entire array
    int (*ptr3)[3] = &arr;   // This points to the whole array, not just an int
    printf("First element via ptr3: %d\n", (*ptr3)[0]); // Outputs: 10

    return 0;
}

```

### 1.3.6 Pointer Arithmetics
It is possible to do basic arithmetic on pointers. For example if we declare a pointer to an array. The pointer points to its first element:
```c
int arr [] = {1,52,3,4,5,6,7};
int * p_arr = arr;
printf("%d" , *p_arr); // output: 1 
printf("%d" , *p_arr+1); // output: 2 because we first dereference pointer to the first element which is 1 then add 1 
printf("%d" , *(p_arr+1)); // output: 52 because we first add one to the memory address of the first eleement then dereference it and therefore it gives the second element in array. 
```
we can also make a pointer that points to the last element in array and then traverse it backwards using pointer arithmetics. 

```c
int arr [] = {1,52,3,4,5,6,7};
int index_of_last_element = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0])-1
int * p_arr = &arr[index_of_last_element];
printf("%d" , *p_arr); // output: 7  
printf("%d" , *(p_arr-1)) // output: 6  
```
### 1.3.7 Pointer to Pointer
You can have pointers that point to other pointers.
```c
int **pptr = &ptr; // pptr is a pointer to ptr
```
## 1.4 Common Mistakes When Handling the pointer
There are some frequent mistakes associated with pointers. Make sure you avoid them when you building you own c programms. 

### 1.4.1 Dereferencing NULL Pointers
Always ensure a pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it. This is very common mistake. You can check if the pointer is reffering to NULL using an if statement. 
```c
    int num = 10; 
    int * ptr = NULL; 
    if (ptr == NULL) {
    printf("The pointer is NULL" );
    }
```

### 1.4.2 Memory Leaks
Forgetting to free dynamically allocated memory can lead to memory leaks. More about memory allocation later.

### 1.4.3 Dangling Pointers
A dangling pointer is a pointer that no longer points to a valid memory location. This situation often occurs when a pointer references memory that has been freed or deleted. Accessing a dangling pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or data corruption.Pointers that point to memory that has been freed can cause errors. Here are some  way to prevent dangling pointers. 

1. **Sett pointers to NULL after freeing memory**
```c
int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
free(ptr);    // Free the memory
ptr = NULL;   // Set the pointer to NULL
```

2. **Check for NULL Before Dereferencing**
Always check if a pointer is NULL before using it. This prevents dereferencing a dangling pointer.

```c
if (ptr != NULL) {
    // Safe to dereference ptr
}
```
