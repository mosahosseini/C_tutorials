In this Tutorial we will introduce input outputs in C 

# Output
In order to be able to output you need to first include `stdio.h` library. Note that like Java, C is also a brace-delimited languages this means that you have to put `;` at the end of the code. 
```c
# include <stdio.h>
```
For output you can use `printf()` function. 
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello World!");
};
```
## Format Specifiers
Functions like printf() needs a format specifier to tell the compiler how to format and display the corresponding argument. Here’s why it's necessary:

**Separation of Format String and Variables:**
Consider the following code,
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int age = 12 ;
    printf("You'r age is: ? "); //  How to say to compiler that there is a variable named age that contains an integer that should be printed ?
}
```

**Handling Multiple Data Types:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int age = 12 ;
    char first_letter = 'M';
    printf("You'r age is: ?  and you'r name starts with: ? "); //  How to say to compiler that there is a variable named age that contains an integer that should be printed ? Also , how to say to compiler that first_letter is a variable of type char that contains a letter.
}
```
### Different format specifiers: 

| Data type | Format Specifier|
|----------|----------|
|%d| Signed integers (int)|
|%u| Unsigned integers|
|%f| Floating-point numbers (float, double)|
|%c|  Characters (char)|
|%s| Strings (arrays of characters)|

### How to use format specifiers
Here is how we can use format specifiers: 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int age = 12 ;
    char first_letter = 'M';
    printf("Your age is: %d  and your name starts with: %c ", age, first_letter); // output-> your age is: 12  and your name starts with: M
}
```
Note that the order of variables in printf is very important. In other words if you change placement of age and FirstLetter the output is incorrect. 


# User Input: 
In order to get input from user we need to use `scanf()` function in the `stdio.h` library. The  `scanf()` function takes format specifiers and also "The memory addres of the variable".  
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int p_age
    scanf("Enter you are: " , &p_age);
    print("you are borned year: %d", 2024-p_age);

}
```


## **`scanf` vs `printf` behavior**:
- **`scanf`**: The `scanf` function needs to modify the values of variables. To do this, it requires the **address** of the variables so it can write the user’s input directly into the memory locations where the variables are stored. That’s why we pass the address of the variables using the `&` operator.
  
- **`printf`**: On the other hand, the `printf` function is used only to **read** and **display** the values stored in the variables. It doesn’t need to change the values, so it only requires the **value** of the variable, not its memory address.
