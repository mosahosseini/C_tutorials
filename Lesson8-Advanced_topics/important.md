When I say "local modification of `root`," I mean that in your original code, the `root` pointer inside the `insert2` function only affects the `root` variable *inside that function*. It doesn't change the `root` in the main function or the calling code.

In C, when you pass a pointer like `root` to a function, you’re actually passing a **copy of that pointer**. So if you assign something new to `root` (like allocating memory for it), that change only affects the `root` variable inside `insert2`—it doesn't update the `root` in the main function.

Here's a simple example:

```c
void exampleFunction(int *ptr) {
    ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));  // This change only affects ptr in this function
}
```

If you call `exampleFunction(somePointer);`, `somePointer` in the main function won’t actually point to the newly allocated memory because the function only changed the *local copy* of the pointer.

To fix this, we need to use a **pointer to the pointer** (a double pointer). This way, when we change `*root`, we’re modifying the original tree structure, not just a local copy. 

So, in `insert2`, we use `BinTree **root`, allowing us to directly change the actual `root` pointer from outside the function.



Using a pointer to a pointer allows you to change the original because it gives you direct access to the memory address of the original pointer itself.

Here’s the key idea:

1. **Pointer Basics**: When you pass a pointer to a function in C, you’re actually passing a **copy of that pointer**. Any changes to this copy only affect the function's local copy of the pointer, not the original pointer in the calling code.

2. **Pointer to Pointer**: By passing a **pointer to the pointer** (a double pointer), you give the function access to the memory address of the original pointer. This way, the function can modify what the original pointer points to, not just a copy.

### Visual Example

Imagine we have a pointer `root` that points to a node in a tree:

- `root` (in main): `0x1234` (the memory address of the node)
- Inside `insert2`, you receive a **copy** of `root`, say `temp = root`. Changing `temp` to point somewhere else won’t affect `root`.

When you use a double pointer, you’re instead passing the address of `root`, which we can call `&root`:
  
- `root`'s address (in main) is `0x5678`.
- With `BinTree **root` in `insert2`, `*root` now refers to the actual `root` pointer in the main function.

### Code Illustration

Here’s how it works in code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void modifyPointer(int **ptr) {
    *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));  // Changing the original pointer's target
    **ptr = 42;  // Assign a value to the new memory location
}

int main() {
    int *originalPtr = NULL;  // original pointer starts as NULL

    modifyPointer(&originalPtr);  // Pass the address of originalPtr

    printf("%d\n", *originalPtr);  // Output: 42
    free(originalPtr);

    return 0;
}
```

1. `originalPtr` is initially `NULL`.
2. We pass `&originalPtr` (a pointer to `originalPtr`) to `modifyPointer`.
3. Inside `modifyPointer`, `*ptr` refers to `originalPtr` itself. By setting `*ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));`, we change `originalPtr` to point to a new memory location.
4. Now, back in `main`, `originalPtr` points to the new memory location, and we can see the change directly.

### Why This Works

By using a pointer to a pointer, the function can access and modify the **actual memory address of `originalPtr`** in `main`. This allows it to point `originalPtr` to new memory (or a new tree node), affecting the original directly.
